            <h2>Why we fight!</h2>
            <p> The only Old Norse source that provides a direct statement about how people gained entrance to Valhalla
                is the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson, a thirteenth-century Icelandic scholar. Snorri wrote many
                generations after Norse paganism had given way to Christianity and ceased to be a living tradition, and
                he often went out of his way to artificially systematize the disparate material in his sources (many of
                which we, too, possess). According to Snorri, those who die in battle are taken to Valhalla, while those
                who die of sickness or old age find themselves in Hel, the underworld, after their departure from the
                land of the living.</p>

            <p> Vikings did not wear much armour. Some chieftains wore chain mail coats, but most relied on a round
                wooden shield for protection.</p>

            <p> Some Viking warriors went into battle wearing wolf or bear skins. These warriors were called
                ‘berserkers’ because they went ‘berserk’ (out of control) and charged fearlessly into battle. Berserkers
                believed that Odin, the god of war, gave them superhuman powers and that they didn't need to wear battle
                armour for protection.</p>

            <h3>Odin</h3>
            <p> Odin (Old Norse: Óðinn) is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology.
                Son of Bor and the giantess (jötunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the Æsir and king of Asgard. He is
                married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, Höðr, Víðarr, and Váli.</p>

            <p> Known as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the
                wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the
                mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said
                to never miss its target.</p>

            <p> A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from
                the Well of Urðr, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin
                himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being Mímir, which recites secret knowledge
                to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to
                Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was
                known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wōtan, all of
                which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *wōđanaz.</p>

            <p> The modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god’s name. (from Old English Wōdnesdæg, “Wōden’s
                day”).</p>

            <h3>Valhalla</h3>
            <p>The dead who reside in Valhalla, the einherjar, live a life that would have been the envy of any Viking
                warrior. All day long, they fight one another, doing countless valorous deeds along the way. But every
                evening, all their wounds are healed, and they are restored to full health.[3] They surely work up quite
                an appetite from all those battles, and their dinners don’t disappoint. Their meat comes from the boar
                Saehrimnir (Old Norse Sæhrímnir, whose meaning is unknown[4]), who comes back to life every time he is
                slaughtered and butchered. For their drink they have mead that comes from the udder of the goat Heidrun
                (Old Norse Heiðrun, whose meaning is unknown[5]). They thereby enjoy an endless supply of their
                exceptionally fine food and drink.[6] They are waited on by the beautiful Valkyries.</p>
